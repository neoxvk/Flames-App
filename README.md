🌈 What's FLAMES?
FLAMES stands for Friends, Lovers, Affectionate, Marriage, Enemy, Siblings. You know, the ultimate ancient science of… well, random letters. 😅

How it works: Enter your name and your crush’s (or whoever’s) name, hit the button, and BOOM! 💥 It’s like flipping a coin, except more dramatic! ✨

👾 The Features:
Sleek Animation: Watch that button light up as if it’s channeling mystical forces! ⚡️💚💥
Catchy Messages: Instead of boring old “calculating…”, our app says things like “Magic's Happening!” or “Results Incoming…”. Because who has time for boring? 😜

Responsive Design: Whether you’re on mobile or desktop, the FLAMES app has your back! 📱💻
